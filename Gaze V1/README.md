# Gaze V1 – Early Prototype

This folder contains our **first working version** of the gaze–based interaction pipeline *before* we built the final integrated system in `Final Integration/`.

It includes:
- Stand-alone **gaze estimation** scripts  
- Stand-alone **blink detection** logic  
- The **receiver** that ran on the laptop  
- The **virtual keyboard**  
- Early **calibration scripts** and **models**

We are keeping this version as a **development snapshot** to document how the system evolved and how each component was originally tested in isolation.  

> **Note:** This folder is **not** part of the final file structure used in the thesis demo.  
> The production-ready implementation lives in the **`Final Integration/`** directory.
