This folder contains our **first complete prototype** of the system before we performed any final integration.  
It includes the separate modules for **gaze estimation**, **blink detection**, the **receiver running on the laptop**, the **virtual keyboard**, and the associated **models and calibration scripts**.  

We keep this version as a **development snapshot** to document how the individual components worked independently, but it is **not the final integrated pipeline** used in the thesis demo.
